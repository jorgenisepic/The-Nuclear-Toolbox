## About ![Built by Jorgen Eduard Olesen](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built_by-Jorgen_Eduard_Olesen-blue?style=flat) ![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In_Development-yellow)


The Nuclear Toolbox is an *open-source*, interactive toolkit designed to make nuclear science more understandable and accessible for students, researchers, and educators. It provides hands-on calculators, visualizations, and educational tools — all built with Python and Streamlit.

Whether you're a beginner curious about radiation or a student exploring nuclear physics, this toolbox gives you the visual tools and calculators to explore topics like radioactive decay, dose exposure, shielding, and isotope behavior — all through an intuitive, Python-powered interface.

This project began as a personal passion and now aims to be a lightweight digital companion for learning radiation, decay physics, and nuclear safety principles.
