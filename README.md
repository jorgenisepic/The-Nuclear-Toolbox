# Rad. Exposure Calc.

Python based command-line tool designed for radiation protection estimation and visualization. 
This project supports educational exploration and applied understanding of ionizing rad. exposure, occup. limits, 
and emergency scenarios commonly encountered in NuclE and health physics contexts.

Features

- Daily Exposure Planning
- Worker Comparison
- Emergency Scenario Assesment
- Data Visualization

  ## Learning Goals

  This project was created as part of my self study in NuclE. I wanted to understand:
  - How radiation exposure is calculated in real life
  - The differnece between public and occupational safety limits
  - How to build useful tool susing Python and Graphing libraries

~Why this exists?

I am currently in 10th grade as of 6/21/25, studying Nuclear Engineering for college on my own,
I wanted to make something that actually works and helps me understand exposure limits and safety.
This is part of a bigger notebook I'm building.

----

## Future Ideas

- Add decay formula visualizations ( WIP!! )
- Make a rad. shielding calc.
- Turn this into a simple web app
- Add preset scenarios, IE. Chernobyl clean up, CT scans, Fukushima, Etc.

Requirements

Python 3.x
`matplotlib` for charts

Install the graph lib:

```bash
pip install matpotlib
```
----
 ## Example use cases 
- How long can I stay in a 0.5 μSv/h room before going over 1 mSv per year?
- Who gets more radiation; someone working 6 hrs a day at low exposure, or 2 hours/day at high exposure?
-  How dangerous is a one time 10-hour exposure at 10 μSv/h?

## WHO MADE THIS?
Created by **Jorgen Eduard Olesen**,  ![Nuclear Engineering Learner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nuclear%20Engineering-Self--Taught-green?style=flat-square&logo=react) ![Student Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Student-10th%20Grade-blue?style=flat-square&logo=BookStack)

a 10th grade student from Denmark with a self-taught passion for nuclear engineering, Python programming,
and scientific visualization.
This project is part of my long-term goal to deeply understand how radiation works, from physical concepts to real-world safety. 
I’m building a full notebook of nuclear engineering tools, diagrams, and simulations as I teach myself everything from scratch.
